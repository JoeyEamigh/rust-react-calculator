# Rust-React Calculator

this is a calculator interfacing Rust with React through WASM

## Disclaimers:

- I know basically nothing about Rust so the code is probably very wrong
- I'm sure there are cleaner ways to make a calculator in TS. I don't care - this was fun
- I plan to add more to this later, like the triangle thing - but I may never update it again
- I am not a programming advisor
