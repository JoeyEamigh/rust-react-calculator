# Rust-React Calculator

this is a calculator interfacing Rust with React through WASM

## Disclaimers:

- I did this in about 3ish hours and it is very bad
- I know basically nothing about Rust so the code is probably very wrong
- I'm sure there are cleaner ways to make a calculator in TS. I don't care - this was fun
- I plan to add more to this later, like the triangle thing - but I may never update it again
- I am not a programming advisor

## Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/JoeyEamigh/rust-react-calculator.git
cd rust-react-calculator
yarn
make
```

(or `yarn start` instead of `make`)
